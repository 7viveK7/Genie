# utils/__init__.py
# This is the __init__.py file for the utils module.
# It can be empty or contain package initialization code.
# This file is required to make Python treat the directory as a package.
# You can also add any module-level docstring or import statements here.
# For example, if you want to import all functions from the submodules,
# you can do it like this:
# from .pdf_utils import extract_text_from_pdf
